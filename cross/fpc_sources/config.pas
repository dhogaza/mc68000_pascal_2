  { Three possibilities exist:

    1. bigcompiler = false, needcaching = true.

       This is the "wimp computer" case.  Data structures are false, and
       the various maxnodeinblock and lowblock constants must be hand
       configured so that each block fits in a disk block and that global
       space is most efficiently used.

    2. bigcompiler = false, needcaching = false.

       Caching is not done, but the structure is maintained and dynamically
       extended as needed.  Basically a compromise, for systems which don't
       support an extremely large address space.  "memory overflow" may
       occur before the entire structure is filled and maximum program size
       may be limited by available memory space.

       In this case, blocksin structure is still used but each block does
       not need to fit in a disk block.

    3. bigcompiler = true, needcaching = false.

       Caching is not done, and read/writeaccess calls are replaced by
       use of the "ref" function directly into a large array.  Used for
       systems with lots of (usually virtual) memory.  FAST!
